# WanderRhodes Chat-Style Implementation Plan
## Robust Phased Approach with Validation Gates

## üéØ **Core Vision**
Build a chat-style POI recommendation system where users have natural conversations and receive expandable POI cards that build into travel plans. Each phase must be fully validated before proceeding.

### **Target UX Flow**
```
User: "I want authentic seafood in Lindos"
AI: üîç "Searching local tavernas near Lindos..." [streaming]
    üìç "Found 5 family-owned restaurants..." [streaming]
    
    [POI Card 1: Taverna Sunset] [Expandable]
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Photo loads progressively
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "Fresh catch daily, family recipe since 1962"
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Add to Plan] button
    
    [POI Card 2: Melenos Fish Taverna] [Expandable]
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Stunning cliff-side location
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Add to Plan] button
    
AI: "Would you like me to check what's nearby for after dinner? üåÖ"
```
